# axoloti-contrib
a collection of stuff for the axoloti board from http://axoloti.be/

most of these patches, if not all, are ridiculously simple.
that doesn't mean they're totally useless tho.

synth: synthesis patches
* fmsynth.axp - a freqency/phase modulation toy
* pulsesynth.axp - a pulse monosynth

utils: various other stuff
* midi-usbtodin.axp - takes a usb midi input and spits it to the DIN output, for all these days when you were glad that you forgot to take a computer to the gig.
* midi-usbtodinpoly.axp - the same but in polyphonic mode which works better for ie legato
